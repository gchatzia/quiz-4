# GitHashingExercise
This project contains two exercises:
- The first one is a script (hash_script) that takes a 4 digit integer as a parameter,
  and produces a hash, using SHA-256. The output hash is stored in hash_output.txt. If
  execution permission is denied, run: chmod u+x hash_script
- The second one is 2 c programs related to signal handling:
  1. mysigcatch.c  Catches the SIGNINT signal and terminates
  2. mysigcatchmodified.c Also catches the SIGINT signal, but terminates in the third catch

There are also the files code-lab-4-explained.txt (gives a brief summary of the lab 4 
examples) and repo.txt (that gives an HTTPS link to the remote github repository).
